# JPP (JSON Plus Plus)

**JPP** is a lightweight C++ library for parsing and handling JSON data, created as a personal learning project.  
This is the second iteration of the project — the first version was built "headfirst", without prior research, as a challenge of raw coding skill (find it under the `old/v1` branch). This time, the goal is to deeply understand how such tools are designed and developed, and to become a better programmer in the process.

> ⚠️ This project is a **work in progress**. Expect missing features, possible bugs, and active experimentation.

## Goals

- Learn about parser design and implementation
- Explore different approaches to tokenization, AST building, and error handling
- Write clean, testable, and idiomatic C++ code
- Build a usable, minimal JSON parser from scratch

## Status

Currently under development. Not ready for production use.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt). You are free to use, modify, and distribute it, with attribution.

## Getting Started (Coming soon)

Instructions on how to build, use, and integrate the library will be added here.

## Contributions

At this stage, this is mainly a solo learning journey, but feel free to open issues or share suggestions.
